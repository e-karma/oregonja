CSS3 Slider Carousel


You can replace span with any thing images, video etc. If you only have 4 spans then .slider-carousel moves
past the last span, then whips back to the starting position. JavaScript has the ability to append elements
 on the fly and that’s the reason that JS slider give the impression of continuous loop. Such capabilities
 are beyond the ability of CSS at the moment, so instead we’ll hide the return to the start by adding a copy
 of the first image at the end.
